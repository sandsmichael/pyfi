Bases: object

Implementation of a Nelson-Siegel interest rate curve model. This curve can be interpreted as a factor model with three factors (including a constant).

factor_matrix(T: Union[float, numpy.ndarray]) → Union[float, numpy.ndarray][source]
Factor loadings for time(s) T as matrix columns, including constant column (=1.0).

factors(T: Union[float, numpy.ndarray]) → Union[Tuple[float, float], Tuple[numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray]][source]
Factor loadings for time(s) T, excluding constant.

forward(T: Union[float, numpy.ndarray]) → Union[float, numpy.ndarray][source]
Instantaneous forward rate(s) of this curve at time(s) T.

zero(T: Union[float, numpy.ndarray]) → Union[float, numpy.ndarray][source]
Zero rate(s) of this curve at time(s) T.


--smoothens the curve for discrepencies that may be present in the par curve at various tenors.
